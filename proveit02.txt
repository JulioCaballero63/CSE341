After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub): https://github.com/JulioCaballero63/CSE341.git

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
    - I follow along with the videos and used pug, handlebars, and ejs display engines. 
    - The video says to delete the handlebars and pug section so my project only has ejs.
    - My program is working properly using express and ejs.
    - I added some dynamic functionality to add a product description. 
    - User can input extra book information in the form.
    - More than one book can be added and displayed.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
    - The program is functioning like the one in the videos. I also added an input for the user to enter the book description, and the description will be stored dynamically.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
    - I watched this weeks videos several times and I am beginning to understand how node works, last semester I used AMP to build a website and I am finding node is similar to the MVC model in AMP.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    - I would change the due date for the team activity, It is very hard to complete all of the videos before I meet with my team, and it is much easier to work on the activity after watching the videos, I felt lost during the week 2 team assignment, only guys who had previously taken this class and dropped it seem to know what they were talking about.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 5
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category. I was able to add extra functionality to the program with out having to follow the instruction from the video step by step.
