1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub): https://github.com/JulioCaballero63/prove_week8_REST_API.git

2. Heroku app link: https://cse341julioc.herokuapp.com 

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
    - I believe the REST_API is working as requested in the prove activity.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
    - The activity says not to change the front end code, the page does not look very good in my opinion because there is text too close to each other.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
    - How to create the endpoints.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    - Change the due date of the team activity to Fridays of Saturdays, it is too much to material to cover by Wednesday.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment: 4
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
   - I think my prove assignment works as required in the activity instructions.
